def chunk_text_with_overlap(text, chunk_size, overlap_size):
    """
    Splits a given text into chunks of specified size with overlapping sections.
    Overlap between the text chunks is necessary as it allows us to maintain the correct text structure better than if sentences are randomly cut in half.

    This function divides a text string into chunks, each containing a specified number of words. 
    Consecutive chunks overlap by a defined number of words. This method is particularly useful 
    for processing large texts in smaller segments while maintaining continuity across those segments.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The text to be chunked.
    chunk_size (int): The number of words in each chunk.
    overlap_size (int): The number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks.

    Returns:

class RateLimiter:
    """
    A class to implement rate limiting functionality, ensuring that the number of actions (or 'tokens') 
    does not exceed a specified maximum limit per minute.

    The rate limiter uses a token bucket algorithm, represented by deques (double-ended queues), 
    to keep track of the number of tokens and their timestamps within the past minute.

    Attributes:
        max_tokens_per_minute (int): The maximum number of tokens that are allowed in one minute.
        tokens_deque (deque): A deque to store the number of tokens generated in the past minute.
        timestamps_deque (deque): A deque to store the timestamps of when tokens were generated in the past minute.

    Methods:
        add_tokens(tokens: int): Adds a specified number of tokens to the rate limiter. If adding the tokens 
        would exceed the maximum limit, the method pauses execution until it is permissible to add the tokens.

        check_tokens(tokens: int) -> bool: Checks if adding a specified number of tokens would exceed the 
        maximum limit, without actually adding them. Returns True if adding the tokens would stay within the 
        limit, and False otherwise.

    Example:
        rate_limiter = RateLimiter(100)  # Rate limiter allowing 100 tokens per minute
        rate_limiter.add_tokens(50)      # Add 50 tokens

    """
    Sends a prompt to the GPT-3.5 API and retrieves the model's response, 
    while managing the rate of API requests using a provided rate limiter.

    This function concatenates a system message with the user's prompt, calculates 
    the total number of tokens, and uses a rate limiter to control the frequency of API requests.
    It handles various API-related errors and retries up to five times in case of failures.

    Parameters:
        prompt (str): The user's input text to be sent to the model.
        system_message (str): A system-generated message that precedes the user's prompt.
        rate_limiter (RateLimiter): An instance of the RateLimiter class to manage API request frequency.
        engine (str, optional): The model engine to use. Defaults to "gpt-3.5-turbo".

    Returns:
        str: The trimmed content of the model's response if successful, None otherwise.

    Raises:
        openai.error.RateLimitError: If the rate limit for the API is exceeded.
        openai.error.APIError: For general API-related errors.
